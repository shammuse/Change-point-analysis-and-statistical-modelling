This project analyzes and forecasts Brent oil prices by examining the effects of significant political, economic, and geopolitical events, such as OPEC policies, international sanctions, and technological advancements. Through advanced modeling techniques, it aims to provide actionable insights for investors, policymakers, and energy companies to enhance strategic planning and risk management in the volatile oil market.

## Core Objectives
This project focuses on:
- Analyzing historical Brent oil prices and related factors.
- Implementing advanced time series and econometric models, such as VAR, ARIMA, and GARCH, to understand trends and volatility.
- Integrating machine learning models, like LSTM, for capturing complex patterns.
- Exploring additional economic, technological, and regulatory factors that impact oil prices.
- Building an interactive dashboard to visualize analysis results and allow users to explore how various events influence oil prices.
  
## Project structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **.github/workflows/**: Configuration files for GitHub Actions to enable continuous integration (CI) and automated testing.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, and preliminary modeling of Brent oil prices.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model implementation.
- **tests/**: Unit tests to ensure the correctness and robustness of the model and data processing logic.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists dependencies and libraries required for the project setup.
- **README.md**: Main documentation file with an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
